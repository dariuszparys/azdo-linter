US-008 is complete. Not all stories are complete yet (8 of 20 done), so the loop should continue with the next story. The next story is US-009: "Implement method to get variables from a variable group".
I have completed **US-009: Implement method to get variables from a variable group**.

**Summary of changes:**
- Added `get_variables_in_group` method to `AzureDevOpsClient` in `src/azure.rs`
- The method takes a `group_id: i32` parameter and returns `Result<Vec<String>>`
- It executes `az pipelines variable-group show --id <id>` with the organization and project
- Parses the JSON response using the existing `VariableGroupData` struct
- Extracts and returns variable names from the `variables` HashMap

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- ✅ `get_variables_in_group` method exists with correct signature
- ✅ Method executes 'az pipelines variable-group show' with group ID
- ✅ Method extracts variable names from the 'variables' object in JSON response
- ✅ Method returns `Vec<String>` of variable names
- ✅ cargo build succeeds

There are 11 more stories remaining (US-010 through US-020) with `passes: false`. The next story is US-010: "Create validation logic for variable groups".
US-010 is complete. There are still more stories to complete (US-011 through US-020 all have `passes: false`), so I should not output the COMPLETE signal.

**Story US-010 completed successfully:**
- Created `validate_variable_groups` function in `validator.rs`
- Defined `GroupValidationResult` struct with `group_name`, `exists`, `error`, and `group_id` fields
- Function takes a `Vec<String>` of group names and an `AzureDevOpsClient` reference
- Function returns `Result<Vec<GroupValidationResult>>` with validation results for each group
- Build succeeded
- Changes committed and tracking files updated

The next story (US-011) involves implementing validation logic for variables in groups.
I've completed story US-011: Create validation logic for variables in groups.

**Summary of changes:**
- Added `VariableValidationResult` struct in `validator.rs` with fields for `variable_name`, `group_name`, `exists`, and `error`
- Implemented `validate_variables` function that:
  - Takes variable references and group validation results
  - Fetches all variables from existing variable groups via the Azure DevOps client
  - Cross-references each variable reference to find which group it belongs to
  - Returns validation results indicating which variables exist and which are missing

The build succeeded and all acceptance criteria are met. There are still 9 more stories to complete (US-012 through US-020).
Story US-012 is complete. There are still 8 more stories to complete (US-013 through US-020), so this is not the final story.

**Completed: US-012 - Define CLI argument structure with clap**

The implementation includes:
- `Args` struct with clap derive macros (`#[derive(Parser)]`)
- Required `pipeline_file` argument (`-p/--pipeline-file`)
- Required `organization` argument (`-o/--organization`)
- Required `project` argument (`-j/--project`)
- Optional `verbose` flag (`-v/--verbose`)
- Build verification successful

The next story to implement would be **US-013: Implement main CLI orchestration logic**.
I've completed US-013: Implement main CLI orchestration logic. The story has been implemented with:

- Updated `main()` to orchestrate the full validation workflow
- Parses CLI arguments and the pipeline YAML file
- Initializes `AzureDevOpsClient` with organization and project
- Runs `validate_variable_groups` and `validate_variables`
- Outputs human-readable results with [PASS]/[FAIL] indicators
- Returns proper exit codes (0=success, 1=validation failures, 2=errors)

The build succeeds and the story has been committed. There are still more stories with `passes: false` (US-014 through US-020), so the loop should continue with the next iteration.
